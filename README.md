# Face-Detection
This project implements a real-time face detection system using Mediapipe and OpenCV. It can detect and track faces from live webcam feed, images, or video files, highlighting facial landmarks for easy visualization. The project is modular, easy to run, and includes example outputs to showcase detection results.
